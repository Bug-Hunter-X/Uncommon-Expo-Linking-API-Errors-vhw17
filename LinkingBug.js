This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The app may not register the URL scheme correctly, resulting in the deep link not being opened. This is often seen when using `Linking.addEventListener` and forgetting to remove the listener, leading to memory leaks and preventing new links from being handled. Another common issue is incorrect configuration of the URL scheme in the `app.json` or `expo.json` file.  The app may fail silently, or in some cases throw a vague error related to a missing or invalid scheme.
